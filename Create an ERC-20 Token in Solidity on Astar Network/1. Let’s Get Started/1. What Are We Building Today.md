# What Are We Building Today

Hello everyone!üåà Today, I‚Äôm thrilled to present the first-ever learning tutorial about Moonbeam for developers on Metaschool.

So what are we building today? We will be crafting our very own ERC20 token using the Solidity programming language and then deploying it on the Moonbeam network. Grasping this project is essential as it lays the groundwork for you to dive deep into coding on Moonbeam with Solidity.

Let‚Äôs glance at how you'll be interacting with the token by the end of this course.

Why Moonbeam? Moonbeam offers a platform that is interoperable with the Ethereum blockchain. It facilitates smart contracts written in Solidity to be seamlessly executed on its network. Some of the world's most significant tech pioneers are leveraging the potential of Moonbeam to foster the growth of Web3.

Additionally, Moonbeam boasts a robust community with numerous dApps operating efficiently. Their developer-friendly initiatives and rewards systems make it a tempting ecosystem for builders.

## Course Overview

We will:

1. Develop an understanding of the Moonbeam blockchain.
2. Learn to draft an ERC20 token using the Solidity programming language.
3. Set up MetaMask for the Moonbeam testnet.
4. Deploy the Solidity smart contract to the Moonbeam blockchain.

## Who Should Enroll in this Course?

This tutorial is tailored for novice web3 developers keen on exploring the Moonbeam blockchain and understanding the deployment of smart contracts on it. A foundational grasp of blockchain, [consensus mechanism](https://metaschool.so/articles/consensus-mechanism-meaning/), and Solidity is recommended, as our prime focus will be on crafting an ERC20 token for Moonbeam.

## Prerequisites

- MetaMask extension installed on your browser ([Chrome extension link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn))

> **Note:** For guidance on setting up your MetaMask, please refer to [this course](https://metaschool.so/courses/understand-and-setup-metamask-account). Ensure you're all set before proceeding with this tutorial.

## Proof of Completion

Upon successful completion, you'll be awarded a unique NFT, a utility token, unlocking myriad opportunities on the Metaschool platform. Here‚Äôs a sneak peek of the NFT.
